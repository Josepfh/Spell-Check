# Spell-Check
In this mini project, I implemented a hash table to improve my understanding of the data structure, which has an access, removal, and find runtime
complexity of O(1). 

The objective of this project is to find a viable wordlist, store the wordlist in a hash table, and check the given input for alternative words using the
wordlist.

Alternative words are considered words that differ from the original word by only 1 letter.
